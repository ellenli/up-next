Up Next also uses these resources:

- [DateTools](https://github.com/MatthewYork/DateTools) to simplify date/time data handling
- [macOS-UI-Kit](https://github.com/alexkaessner/macOS-UI-Kit) for rapid prototyping

This GitHub repo hosts the Up Next [website](http://ellen.li/up-next/) and [feature backlog](https://github.com/ellenli/up-next/projects/1). If you encounter any bugs or have a feature request, [add an issue](https://github.com/ellenli/up-next/issues/new) (or [get in touch](https://twitter.com/ellenxli)) and we'll take it from there.
